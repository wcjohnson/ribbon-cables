# Ribbon Cables

Ribbon cables multiplex 16 circuit network wires (8 red, 8 green) using 1x1 entities that connect to each other using a customized cable network. This allows you to:

- Fit more circuitry into smaller spaces.
- Move more information over long distances.
- Connect modules compactly using single data cables rather than a lot of power poles.
- **Actual zero UPS impact** - No polling or on-tick code. The simulated wire connections are accomplished using hidden script wires, which have the same speed as actual wire connections.
- **Full flip, rotation, copy/paste, blueprinting, and undo support** thanks to the magic of bplib.
